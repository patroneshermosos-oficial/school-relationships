### Collaboration Enhancement Proposal

#### Introduction

This document outlines potential strategies to enhance the collaboration between BP and Triana School in Aguascalientes (AGS). While the current collaboration fell short of expected outcomes due to a change in personnel managing the project, the following ideas aim to foster a more fruitful collaboration in the future.

#### Proposed Ideas

1. **Monthly Interviews with BP Collaborators**: Establish a series of monthly interviews featuring girls who actively collaborate with BP. These interviews would provide an opportunity for them to share their personal experiences and motivations for getting involved in STEM areas. This initiative can serve as an inspiring platform for other girls considering similar paths.

2. **Leverage the "Houses" System**: Triana School already has a "houses" system in place, reminiscent of the concept found in the Harry Potter series. To encourage girls' participation in BP courses, leverage this existing structure by incentivizing their involvement. Girls who participate in BP courses and demonstrate their commitment could earn points for their respective houses, offering a tangible reward or recognition for their achievements.

3. **Engage Moms and Teachers**: Encourage the active participation of mothers and teachers in BP courses, moving beyond the focus solely on students. By involving these important stakeholders, we can create a more supportive and holistic learning environment. This engagement can help inspire girls to pursue STEM education with the support and encouragement of their families and educators.

4. **Interviews with STEM-Engaged Teachers**: Conduct additional interviews with teachers from Triana School who actively participate in STEM areas. These interviews would provide valuable insights into their experiences, offering inspiration and mentorship to students considering careers in STEM.

5. **Empower Girls' Input**: Develop a questionnaire to gather girls' feedback on their interests and the STEM topics they would like to explore further. Based on their responses, BP can create targeted materials and courses to cater to their specific preferences. By involving girls in the decision-making process, we empower them as important contributors to the content and establish a stronger sense of community within BP.

#### Conclusion

These proposed initiatives aim to enhance the collaboration between BP and Triana School in Aguascalientes. By implementing these strategies, we can create a more engaging and supportive environment for girls in STEM education. Together, we can foster a community that values their contributions, empowers their growth, and paves the way for a future generation of STEM leaders.
